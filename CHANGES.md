To be released.


Version 0.1.4
-------------

Released on August 26, 2025.

 -  Upgraded Fedifyh to 1.4.15 which fixes a bug where HTTP Signature
    verification failed for requests having `created` or `expires` fields
    in their `Signature` header, causing `500 Internal Server Error` responses
    in inbox handlers.


Version 0.1.3
-------------

Released on August 25, 2025.

 -  Upgraded Fedify to 1.4.14, which fixes a bug where ActivityPub Discovery
    failed to recognize XHTML self-closing `<link>` tags.  The HTML/XHTML parser
    now correctly handles whitespace before the self-closing slash (`/>`),
    improving compatibility with XHTML documents that follow the self-closing
    tag format.

-------------

Released on August 8, 2025.

    vulnerability allowing actor impersonation.  [[CVE-2025-54888]]
