BotKit changelog
================

Version 0.4.0
-------------

To be released.

### @fedify/botkit

 -  Added a remote follow button to the web interface.
    [[#10], [#14] by Hyeonseo Kim]

     -  Added a Follow button on the bot's profile page that allows users to
        follow the bot from their own fediverse instance without manual
        searching.
     -  When clicked, the button opens a modal dialog where users can enter
        their fediverse handle (e.g., `@username@instance.com`).
     -  The feature uses WebFinger to discover the user's instance and
        automatically redirects to the appropriate follow page using the OStatus
        subscribe protocol.
